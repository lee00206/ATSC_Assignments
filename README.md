# ATSC_Assignments
These are the assignment submissions for ATSC 301 (Climate Measurement and Analytics) course at UBC.<br><br>
*final_takehome* shows the seasonal changes in the landsat scenes.<br>

*assginment4* converts Modis channel 30 and Modis channel 31 to calibrated radiances using the mid-range wavelength for each channel. It then calculates the brightness temperature for each channel and it plots and brightness temperature difference Tbright31 - Tbright30.
